- [Using Emacs as editor](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/54)
- [The Framework](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/559)


## Congrats!
Now you know how to navigate into a Unix system!

It’s time to test and decide what will be your favorite text editor on your sandbox: **Emacs** or **Vi**.

During this project you will play with **Emacs**.


## Resources
**Read or watch**:
- [A Guided Tour of Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/)


## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/), without the help of Google:


### General
- What is Emacs
- Who is Richard Stallman
- How to open and save files
- What is a buffer and how to switch from one to the other
- How to use the mark and the point to set the region
- How to cut and paste lines and regions
- How to search forward and backward
- How to invoke commands by name
- How to undo

- You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
- Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.


## Requirements
- All tasks **must be** done inside the sandbox `Ubuntu 20.04`
- Your sandbox **must be available at the end of this project** - the Checker will access to it at midnight for running the correction!
- The answer of a task must be in a specific file
- Each answer file must contain only the command to execute in Emacs for solving the task. Example: “What is the command to write buffer to a specified file?” -> the file should contain only `C-x C-w`
